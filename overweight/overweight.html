      <p id="def">A low fat diet, as the name implies, is a dietary pattern that limits the fat intake at about 1/3 of the total daily calories consumed. It consists of little fat, particularly saturated fats and cholesterol which lead to increased blood cholesterol levels and heart attack.
        This type of diet plan to reduce obesity focuses on foods that contain whole grains, fruits and vegetables. It is directed towards weight loss and treatment of certain diseases by offering 20 to 30 percent of total daily calories from fat. Plenty of vegetables and proteins in a typical low fat diet supply the body with energy but very little fats.
        However, fats should not be eliminated entirely as some dietary fat is needed for good health, supplying energy and fat soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K. Studies have revealed that the right kinds of fats can actually help in losing weight. Hence, the prime focus of healthy diet plan for obesity is on limiting the unhealthy fats and consumption of right amounts of fats.
        Low-fat diets have been promoted for the prevention of heart disease. Lowering fat intake from 35-40% of total calories to 15-20% of total calories has been shown to decrease total and LDL cholesterol by 10 to 20%; however, most of this decrease is due to a reduction in saturated fat intake.
