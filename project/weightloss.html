                                            <p>General Guidelines:</p>
                                            <p>Protein: Consume lean protein sources with each meal to support muscle repair and growth. Aim for around 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.</p>
                                                <p>Carbohydrates: Choose complex carbohydrates for sustained energy levels throughout the day. Focus on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.</p>
                                               <p> Fats: Include healthy fats from sources like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil to support hormone production and overall health.</p>
                                                <p>Hydration: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated, especially during and after workouts.</p>
                                                <p>Portion Control: Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating and to ensure you're getting the right balance of nutrients.</p>
                                               <p> Timing: Space out your meals evenly throughout the day to provide a steady supply of nutrients to your muscles.</p>
                                               <p> Remember to adjust portion sizes and calorie intake based on your individual needs, goals, and activity level. Additionally, consider consulting with a nutritionist or dietitian to tailor a diet plan specifically for your muscle-building goals and overall health.
