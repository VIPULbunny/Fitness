            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p>Here's the diet plan for Day 1:</p>
            <ul>
                <p><b>BREAKFAST :</b>Keep your breakfast light but tasty with a big bowl of oats, chia seeds, whole cream milk, and fruits. Always go for seasonal ones, but you can also opt for some dried fruits. 
                    <p><b>LUNCH:</b> Opt for a creamy cottage cheese curry with some whole wheat chapatis for lunch.</p>
                    <p><b>DINNER: </b> Go for spaghetti cooked in fresh tomato puree with a side of broccoli or spinach.</p>
            </ul>
    </div>

            <section id="day2">
                <h2>Day 2</h2>
                <p>Breakfast:
                    Mix your love for peanut butter and toast for breakfast on day two. Drizzle a bit of chocolate syrup or honey according to your taste. Add in a glass of milk or coffee and fruit, and there you go.
                    Lunch:
                    Opt for an egg salad for lunch. Two or three hard-boiled eggs, chopped onions, tomatoes, garlic, lettuce, cucumber, carrots and avocados, grated cheese and salt to taste. You can also add some coriander and lemon juice for some freshness.
                    ‍Evening Snacks:
                    Evening snacks can include your staple protein shake and a small mango.
                    ‍Dinner:
                    Finish the day right with the porridge of your choice but don’t forget to include as many veggies as you can. You can also have a bowl of full-fat yoghurt to complement the porridge. </p>
                </ul>

                    <h2>Day 3</h2>
                    <p>Breakfast:
                        Wednesday! It's egg day! Scrambled or sunny-side up or a rich omelette, have your favourite kind of eggs. Serve a mug of hot chocolate or coffee made with whole cream milk.
                        Lunch:
                        Go for a South Indian meal. Idli and sambar with chutney is the way to go in the afternoons. Don’t forget to have a cup of rasam too.
                        Evening Snacks:
                        As the evening is approaching, feeling hungry again? Make sure that you do not go for cheese and crackers to satisfy your salty cravings. However, if you are more of a sweet-kinda person, a fruit smoothie is the solution.
                        Dinner:
                        For dinner, have salmon or other oily fish of your choice. Oven-baked salmon fillet, sprinkled with sesame oil and sesame seeds + wholemeal couscous + 2 cups cooked vegetables. Serve hummus.</p>

                        <h2>Day 4</h2>
                        <p>Breakfast:
                            Good job! You’re halfway there! Time to celebrate that with an Instagrammable breakfast. Go for poached eggs on toast with a side of sauteed veggies. And your staple protein shake.
                            Lunch:
                            For lunch, go for good old fish and chips. Finish the meal with mashed potatoes and lemon wedges.
                            Evening Snacks:
                            Since your first half of the day has been protein-rich, keep your snacks simple with cucumber slices. Easy to nibble on the go, you can also add chaat masala to make it a bit more fun.
                            Dinner:
                            For dinner, go for mango chicken and corn. Grilled chicken thighs served with mango salsa, corn on the cob & 1.5 cups baked vegetables (e.g. carrot, onion, beans) in olive oil. End the day with seasonal fruit for dessert.</p>
                        </ul>

                            <p>Breakfast:
                                Assuming it’s Friday, it surely should be “Friyay”. Go for bread and jam sandwiches, a bowl of assorted berries and your favourite beverage made with whole fat milk.
                                Lunch:
                                Have potato and quinoa salad for lunch. Add vegetables like cucumbers, tomatoes and as many leafy greens as possible.
                                Evening Snacks:
                                Remember when we talked about how dark chocolate is healthy? It’s time to include it in your diet today to celebrate the weekend mood. Accompany it with prunes, and they go well together.
                                Dinner:
                                It is the return of pasta (preferably cooked in another way). Try spinach ravioli for a healthy alternative, or try new cuisine. Both are soupy and yummy.</p>

                                <p>Finally, the weekend is here, and you’re so close to finishing your diet plan to gain weight. 
                                    Breakfast:
                                    Here’s a recipe for Strawberry oats! Strawberry And Yogurt Oats.Remember sipping strawberry milkshakes through bendy straws on hot summer childhood days? This recipe is for all you people out there who still enjoy strawberry flavoured food. And if there’s a way to make it healthy? There should be nothing stopping you.‍
                                    What do you need? There are a handful of strawberries, greek yoghurt, oats, honey, or sugar-free maple syrup and milk. You can also use flavoured protein powder with it.
                                    Half cups of milk, oats and yoghurt each should work.
                                    Mix all the ingredients (except strawberries) in a jar or a bowl before going to bed.
                                    Leave it in the refrigerator overnight. This will give your oats a naturally creamy texture.
                                    Top the oats with sliced strawberries and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup in the morning, and enjoy your healthy breakfast.
                                    You can also replace strawberries with bananas.
                                    Lunch:
                                    The perfect choice is a British dish called bubble and squeaks for lunch. The idea is to get the best of your weekly leftovers, potatoes, cabbage, and meat (if you have it) and pan-fry it. It’s filling and tastes good too. 
                                    Evening Snacks:
                                    Snack on carrots and hummus on day six.
                                    Dinner:
                                    End the day with one pot of creamy chicken and mushroom pasta. You can surely add more vegetables if you like. Pair it with your favourite wine. </p>

                                    <h2>Day 7 </h2>
                                    <p>Chill on day seven by having your breakfast, either in bed or on the go. Any guesses?‍
                                        Breakfast:
                                        A granola bar and a mug of coffee made with whole cream milk.
                                        Lunch:
                                        Include red meat with a bowl of well dressed green salad for lunch. Olive oil works pretty much with all kinds of salads. 
                                        Evening Snacks:
                                        Catch a movie on your favourite streaming platform and enjoy the weekend with a big bowl of popcorn. Salted, butter, caramel? Your pick!
                                        Dinner:
                                        End the day, week and the weekly diet plan with your favourite street food. Hard workers deserve a cheat meal, don’t they? That concludes your week of a balanced, nourishing diet plan for a healthier body mass!</p>
